# eSpeak NG Pure-JS Port — Agent Contract

## Project definition

This project is a behavior-compatible, pure-JavaScript downstream implementation of current eSpeak NG.
The upstream C implementation is the behavioral oracle. The goal is not to redesign TTS or create an
"eSpeak-like" engine.

## Non-negotiable constraints

1. No WASM.
2. No native modules.
3. No browser Web Speech API.
4. No neural TTS.
5. No external pronunciation engine/dictionary unless explicitly approved.
6. Do not invent pronunciation rules.
7. Do not silently omit behavior. Unsupported behavior must be reported and tested.
8. Preserve integer/fixed-point semantics where the C implementation depends on them.
9. Keep language/source data separate from JS runtime code.
10. Do not optimize by changing behavior before differential tests pass.
11. Do not couple core code to Vela, browser, Node audio, or filesystem APIs.
12. Every migrated behavior needs a deterministic test or an explicit documented exception.

## Repository model

- `upstream/espeak-ng/`: immutable upstream checkout pinned to a commit.
- `src/`: pure-JS implementation.
- `data/`: generated JS-runtime data packs, never hand-edited.
- `tools/`: build, oracle, conversion, comparison and benchmark tooling.
- `tests/`: unit, differential, regression, fuzz and performance tests.

## Required implementation style

Prefer typed arrays, integer IDs and reusable buffers over large object graphs.
Avoid per-phoneme object allocation in hot paths.
Do not use JS strings as a substitute for internal Unicode code-point arrays when code-point
semantics matter.

## Definition of done

A stage is complete only when:
- its public/internal contract is documented;
- tests cover normal and boundary cases;
- C-vs-JS differential tests pass where applicable;
- unsupported behavior is enumerated;
- no unexplained allocations or dependencies were introduced;
- the stage's acceptance criteria below are satisfied.

## Agent behavior

If the C implementation is ambiguous, stop and inspect the upstream source/tests. Do not guess.
If an upstream dependency crosses the current stage boundary, create a minimal interface rather than
implementing the next stage early.

# M15 — Mandarin / Additional Languages

## Goal

Add Mandarin only after the single-language pipeline is stable.

## Scope

- selected Mandarin voice;
- its dictionary and extended dictionary data;
- phoneme/tonal behavior;
- language-specific prosody;
- mixed-script input where upstream supports it.

## Critical rule

Do not insert an external Han-to-Pinyin library merely to make Chinese work. The port should follow
the selected eSpeak NG language data and translation behavior.

## Tests

Include:
- common characters;
- polyphonic characters;
- numbers;
- punctuation;
- mixed Chinese/Latin;
- tone-bearing words;
- long sentences.

## Acceptance

Mandarin phoneme output passes imported upstream tests and representative golden corpus.
Audio is compared with the C oracle using the same metrics as M10.
